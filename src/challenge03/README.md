# ðŸ›Œ Escape from Freddy's nightmare

You are trapped in a nightmare where **Freddy Krueger** is chasing you ðŸ˜­. The dream is represented as a grid of cells, where each cell has a numeric value indicating the *danger level* of that part of the dream.

You must find the **safest path** (i.e., the one with the lowest total danger value) from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

In this challenge, you can only move **right** or **down** (you cannot move backwards or diagonally), and you must calculate the total danger level of the safest path.

The nightmare is represented by a matrix `dream` of size `n x m`, where each cell is a positive number representing the danger level of that cell in the dream.

You must return the total danger level of the safest path from the top-left corner (position `[0][0]`) to the bottom-right corner (position `[n-1][m-1]`).

```javascript
const dream = [
  [1, 3, 1],
  [1, 5, 1],
  [4, 2, 1],
]

const bestPath = findSafestPath(dream) // Returns 7
// The best path is:
// [0, 0] -> 1
// [0, 1] -> 3
// [0, 2] -> 1
// [1, 2] -> 1
// [2, 2] -> 1

// 1 -> 3 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 = 7
```
